jeff_dasovich|Notes inbox|to my CA friends|My advice to President W or to the '04 GOP nominee in the unfortunate case that it's not W running for re-election:  Never  ever  ever again step foot in the state of California during the next four years including your race for re-election. The only exception would be to attend Ronald Reagan's funeral.  It's a waste of time.  As president  make regular trips to Florida  Illinois  Michigan  PA  Wisconsin and any other state that doesn't cost you $12 million and hours of wasted time in the air to get there  only to reject you by a solid 13 percentage points. If a candidate like you can't win in CA  then a total GOP abandonment of the state should be imposed for the next millennium. I don't care how many electoral votes they may have. You're young  attractive (which is usually all it takes in CA)  you spent lots time and money  had an opponent who spent nothing  sold your political soul by disavowing 189 and 209 in order to reach out to minorities and were right on all the issues for the techies like tort reform  taxes and rolling back regulations.  How can a candidate try to influence the deep thinkers who call CA home when you're up against the sound advice they receive from Cher  Babs  the Baldwin Brothers  the DreamWorks team  Whoopie and Rosie. It's obvious that Californians would rather send to Washington  someone who can inspire a hit TV program like the  West Wing   two liberal senators (one of whom is the shrillest  most hypocritical apologist in political history) and a vast majority of liberals to the  U.S. House while rejecting decent people like Jim Rogan  Steve Kynendall and Brian Bilbray.  Once in office  you should work with the Republican congress to reward these Californians by ensuring that they receive no highway money  no research money and most of all  no disaster relief money. The last one should really hurt since they're due for another big one  or a big fire  or a big mud slide  or a big Pacific storm.  Of course  this advice is coming from someone who now calls a state home that has decided to send to the United States Senate  one of the most truthful  honest  humble  dedicated and caring individuals ever to unselfishly enter public life. I mean elected public life  because she's already been working on the issues that really matter to families for over 30 years.  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.

shackleton-s|Notes inbox| Re: Tech contact for ITG Europe Platform installation - ENA and ECT Investments 	 Inc.|Further to my voicemail message yesterday I wanted to advise the outcome of  our latest discussions with John Greene and Gary Hickerson with respect to  the corporate structure for equities trading by London based employees.   The recommendation is that an agent (which will be a UK incorporated entity)  will incur the costs of those employees based in London. The UK agent will  arrange equities transactions in the name of ENA (ie. ENA will be the  principal to the trade) in accordance with a services agreement. The services  agreement will be supplemented by detailed daily instructions issued by ENA  employees based in Houston which will set out strict limits under which the  UK agent can arrange such equity transactions. Detailed procedures will be  drafted which if properly observed should prevent the establishment of a tax  presence for ENA in the UK (a deemed UK tax presence through the UK agent).  These procedures are being developed in conjunction with the relevant  commercial parties (John Greene  Gary Hickerson etc) to ensure that they are  both practical and effective and are not merely a  rubber-stamping  exercise  which would not afford adequate protection against the creation of a UK tax  presence for ENA.  Whether EEFT will be the agent or a newly incorporated UK entity is subject  to some further due diligence on the UK regulatory side. The strong  preference is not to use EEFT if possible.  Thus with regard to the Instinet trading system  the party which will execute  the trades as principal via Instinet will be ENA. The services performed by  the agent in arranging the transactions for ENA via Instinet  will need to be  governed by the same services agreement and procedures outlined above in  respect of offline trades.   I have not had the opportunity to discuss the above proposal with our  colleagues in ENA tax but they are familiar with the alternative scenarios  which were under consideration. If further discussion of this issue is needed  urgently I can be contacted for the rest of the week at the Swissotel   Istanbul  Turkey (8 hours ahead of Houston time) - telephone # 90 212 259 01  01; fax # 90 212 326 11 22 or alternatively try mobile # (44) 77 88 437 195.  I will also be picking up voicemail on 44 207 783 5326.  Regards Janine    To: Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Janine Juggins/LON/ECT@ECT  Jordan Mintz/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Tech contact for ITG Europe Platform installation - ENA and ECT  Investments  Inc.    As just described in my earlier E-mail on this matter  this raises several  concerns and is not a good idea.  It would be preferable to have one of our  foreign affiliates contract for the service.  Separately  it appears that a  form of trading for ENA is contemplated in London which  as we have  discussed  raises serious tax nexus concerns for us.  Consequently  I have  cc'd Janine Juggins on this E-mail so that she is aware of matters and can  explore to see what is actually contemplated.  Janine  I suspect that we need  to clarify on whose behalf people work while in London (EEL?).  I will be in  Canada this week and will try to speak with you while away but   alternatively  you can speak with Janine directly and/or contact me at the  Hotel Vancouver in Vancouver  British Columbia.

I don't  really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group  worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original  install.  If so  please use the same architecture.  If not  please consider  the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being  in Houston  let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London  install so the two sites are in synch.  This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may  want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on  this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it  will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until  further notice.

Doug is really responsible for gas as  an adjunct to their local efforts  as well as a change to indicate  also as  we discussed  that these responsibilites are flexible  in response to  changing commercial priorities  as well as the need to support the other  Wholesale businesses.   mcs ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT on 10/04/2001  07:45 ---------------------------   Richard Lewis 09/04/2001 19:17 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Eric Shaw/LON/ECT@ECT  Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON  Richard  Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron  Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT  Mark  Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Enron Europe Governtal & Regulatory Affairs Organization  Announcement    Paul Dawson covers the coal group as well (any others  Mark?) .

Mark - please let me know once we have spoken to the five senior managers in your group as we do not want to  send this out until either you  Michael or I have spoken to them about this structure.   Draft  After nearly five years in London  Mark Schroeder will be returning to the US  on April 11th to join the North American Coal Business with responsibility  for origination in the utility sector.  Under Mark s leadership  his team has  made significant contributions towards Enron Europe s &first mover8 advantage  and its status as the leading new entrant in the liberalizing pan)European  energy markets.  We wish him well in his new commercial role.   With Mark s departure  the day-to-day management of the Government &  Regulatory Affairs Department in Europe will rest with Peter Styles  Paul  Dawson  Paul Hennemeyer  and Doug Wood.  Nick O Day will continue in his  current leadership capacity in Japan.  Each of these five individuals and  their groups will now jointly report to the business heads and to Rick  Shapiro  in the Government Affairs team in Houston. Rick Shapiro will  continue to manage Government Affairs for the Americas.  While the team  members responsibilities will vary from time-to-time in response to shifting  commercial priorities  as well as the need to support other Enron Wholesale  Services' business units from time-to-time  the general areas of  responsibility will be as follows:  Peter Styles  based in Brussels  will continue to have responsibilty for our  EU and Netherlands advocacy.   Paul Hennemeyer will lead efforts in the  German speaking countries (Germany  Austria  Switzerland) as well as France  and Belgium.  Peter and Paul will report to Eric Shaw.  While secunded to the  commercial team in France  Philip Davies will address Nordic market issues on  an ad hoc basis and also report to Paul on these issues.    Paul Dawson will lead our UK  Spain and Italian power regulatory efforts as  well as the gas regulatory work in the UK.  Doug Wood will support the  Continental Gas team and the Central and Southeastern Europe Origination  efforts  while also addressing the UK Climate Change Levy.  Doug's role in  gas will continue to be to supplement  and not to supplant  the efforts of  each of the team members' geographic responsibilities noted on the  organisation chart.  Paul and Doug will report to Richard Lewis locally.  Nick O Day will also continue to report to Joe Hirl in Japan.    Other regulatory support provided by Mark Schroder will be addressed in  another organizational announcement that will be sent out from Governmental Affairs in Houston.  Attached is the revised  organization chart that now reflects the Governmental & Regulatory Affairs  organization in Enron Europe.

Kaiser Aluminum closed its smelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late 2000  choosing to resell contracted power from the BPA on the spot market. According to the Spokesman Review   Kaiser netted more than $460 million from the sales.  Other aluminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring 2001 with Bonneville. Under these agreements  the companies agreed to keep smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region  and BPA agreed  in return  to give the smelters  when they restarted operations  a $20 per megawatt-hour (MWh) credit for obtaining power from sources other than BPA. Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA that negates a  take-or-pay  clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the federal power whether used or not. BPA said   Under the agreement signed today  Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take all the power under the contract...And if [BPA] can't resell it  we are not going to hold [Kaiser] liable for the difference   Clearing Up reported. As a concession for the elimination of the  take-or-pay  clause  Kaiser will receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its 240 MW load. Kaiser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was using the money it had gained reselling power  to pay down long-term debt  rebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuses   rather than splitting the money between workers that had been laid off  the BPA  and building generation  AP reported.

Texan Doll  had previously worked for several communications and consulting firms   and will be receiving a salary of $200 000 as the power authority's CEO  according to the San Francisco Chronicle. S. David Freeman  the authority's chair  will retain his post. Freeman said he will  handle fewer administrative duties   and will  be able to devote more time to reaching out to interest groups such as the Legislature and consumer groups   The Chronicle reported. According to a 7 October report in the Orange County Register  consumer groups  businesses  and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the power authority  which has vowed to secure nearly 3 000 megawatts (MW) of power by summer 2002 to avoid power shortages. The power authority  which was created by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May 2001  can issue up to $5 billion in bonds to bolster the state's power supply through financing new renewable generation or peaker projects. The Register said that businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates could be the result of the power authority initiative to bring 1 000 MW of green power and 2 000 MW of peaker generation on line by summer 2002. The state's Joint Legislative Audit Committee would look into the authority's planned purchases  according to the committee chair  Assembly member Fred Keeley. Keeley said  it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law   the Register reported. More... <https://www2.enronforum.com/content?content_id=115979903>  United States-Energy:  FERC Refunds Ordered (IB) On 5 October  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered four power marketers to provide refunds for July sales that exceeded a federally mandated price limit. Dynegy Corp.  Mirant Corp.  Williams Cos.  and Reliant Energy were the companies specifically mentioned. Under a 19 June FERC order  price limits were established in 11 Western states to help tame the volatile electricity spot market. The June order stated that companies charging in excess of the mitigated price had seven days past the end of the month in question to file justifications for their overcharges. The 5 October order said that the aforementioned companies filed justifications  but all were rejected  and that other companies that overcharged during July  but did not file justifications  would also be subject to ordered refunds. Although FERC did not release specific figures  the California Independent System Operator said that total overcharges for the month amounted to $260 000  The Los Angeles Times reported. The commission's order explained the rejection of cost justifications for the four companies. The explanations by Mirant and Dynegy  filed more than seven days after July ended  were  untimely and...neither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transactions   according to the document. Reliant's filing was  not consistent with the requirements of the June 19 Order   and Willams  did not provide any cost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the commission's pricing methodology   the commissioners wrote. A Mirant spokesman told Reuters that  his company was ordered to refund $33 800   while a Williams spokesman told the LA Times  $30 000 worth of electricity sales are subject to the FERC rebate for both June and July.

Enron's Tim Beldon wrote me that he would consider it.  The PX's Gene Waas was concerned based on previous experiences of letting data go to the WSJ.  I talked with Dynegy's Lynn Lednicky this morning and he suggested that the PX has aggregated data for several days  and that releasing the aggregate data with individual bid data from our members would give the WSJ a better window into the issues.  That is  simply releasing your bid data will not tell the WSJ anything of value.  I know that Rebecca would insist that the dates for which any data are polled our at her choice  not ours.  It must be necessary to assure there is no possibility of bias.  I am wondering if the PX would be willing to assist us by putting together aggregate data for days which the WSJ selects  and then give us the opportunity to release our individual data for the same days?   I am also wondering if we shouldn't have an off-the-record teleconference call with the WSJ whereby both sides can get a better understanding of what the WSJ wants  and how we can best provide it. Would anyone be interested in me setting up such a meeting for next week  say Wednesday or Thursday?  gba    *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.

weldon-c|Stagecoach| Stagecoach gas questions|Hi guys   I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the  answers to most of these  I was just wondering if you had any insight to the  rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if  you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this  under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you  guys against each other  I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso  and ask questions they've already answered.   1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg  can EES deliver  this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?  2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If  interruptible  will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm  storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?      3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP  cost of  carry  in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are  there any  IN STORAGE   transfer costs?   4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?  5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach  project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES  inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?  6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a  basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be  firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?    7.  If possible  can EES  pick  an alternate delivery point as our primary  point of delivery for this project?    I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set  aside - will this work for you Mark?

symes-k|Ees| Re: Daily EES Positions through 4/19|Hey Kate   For 4/15 and 4/16  our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside  Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in  your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be  increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?  Also  The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday  (which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality   it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside  and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where  it had been for a while.  In your current file  you have the correct value of  0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were  at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Tony   I assume Lou briefed you on the situation.  I think the most recent liquids  sample had pcbs in excess of 50 ppm.  That is well in excess of the  contractual limit that I recall to be 1 ppm.  Our research a few months ago  was about options to force the interconnect back open above 250 mm/d if the  samples came back clean.  Now  the issue is  given dirty samples  what can we  do to keep PGE from slamming the interconnect shut.  We need to complete our  research/thinking immediately and have a spectrum of options ready to  discuss.  Seriously  I am reviewing with Lou the option of a preemptive shut  down of the interconnect  but that looks like an unwise strategy so far.  ALL  ideas are worth considering.  Frank  Steve  and Maria  anything in your  memory banks on TW or FERC jurisprudence that would prevent a Hinshaw from  refusing to schedule transport volumes through a point even if the Hinshaw  seemed to have clear contractual rights to refuse to schedule volumes based  on gas quality/contamination concerns?  I don't think TW's tariff has a  specific PCB spec.   DF      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.

Indeed  some CEC staff have used sought to obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch instructions or  perhaps  identification of generation units for  retirement.   The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to  integrated resource planning.   The BRPU returns!  Anyway  we will be discussing this further at the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.  We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes available.  -----Original Message----- From: Andy Brown [mailto:abb@eslawfirm.com] Sent: Thursday  October 25  2001 10:36 AM To: Steven Kelly; doug kerner; Jan Smutny-Jones Subject: highlights from CPUC meeting Importance: High   FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress  with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.  CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to  integrated resource planning  with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates utility construction of new generation projects  but also calls for life-cycle cost analysis of all options  including new asset construction  power purchase agreements  conservation  transmission  etc.  CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for reliability purposes (lines to NV  AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re economic projects.  CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties remain free to negotiation changes  but that they must move forward on ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract amendments with SCE's.  CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation. PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur  but notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained assets  and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that require market valuation.  It is also unclear  notwithstanding the CPUC settlement with SCE  how post-transitions period costs will be recovered per that agreement.   -- Andrew Brown Sacramento  CA andybrwn@earthlink.net      *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.

donohoe-t|Drafts| RE: Resumes|Any one on the desk can carry any position they want.  The only area we are not to trade is the california market.  That VAR is left for those traders.  We do specialize in our own area and for different time periods.  We each trade all products(physical and financial) for our respective time periods.  Our specialties are as follows:  Tom Donohoe - current and prompt month ANR SE and M2  NGPL STX/LA/TXOK/GCML  TRKL STX/ELA/WLA/Mainline  Reliant all zones and MRT - not much happens here.  Kevin Ruscitti - All the same areas plus financial Prompt Mich and Consumers.  Andy Lewis - ANR SW  Panhandle Field  OGT  NGPL Amarillo Leg  NNG  Jason Williams - Same as Andy but for Current and Prompt  Jim Simpson - Current and prompt Chicago  Martin Cuilla - Canadian areas that feed into Chicago  Mich and Wisconsin.  Hunter Shively - VP over all Central Trading.  I believe that all the locations are correct.  As you can see we have the bases covered.  The important thing is that we are not limited to trade only our areas.  Any of us can trade any location in the US except California.  The long term traders are set up by area.  Brynat Fryhart covers all the Oklahoma/Arkansas midcontinet area.  He has a great relashionship with these folks.  Sylvia Polan and Russel Murrel covers Michigan.  Patrice Thurston covers Chicago.  Linda Roberts covers the supply for Bryants area.  She also has excellent contacts.  Laura Luce is the VP over all the marketers.  We then have 10 people scheduling all the gas. We need so many because of the amount of gas transacted.  We then have back office personnel that run our books.  The way the desk works is that we as traders make the market for anyone that wants to trade our specific areas. -----Original Message----- From: Audrey Cullen Davis [mailto:ACullen@FirstCallAssociates.com] Sent: Saturday  November 17  2001 10:38 AM To: Donohoe  Tom Subject: RE: Resumes   Hi Tom   I will need an idea of long term traders as well.

I know you and/or your people have been discussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project. It is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support  involvement  participation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project unfolds.  Now I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference  March 8-10  2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.  First  I am sure you are aware  we are holding our third annual Milken Institute Global Conference March 8-10  2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have a heavy contingent of institutional investors  corporate leaders  and technology  media and policy people in the audience.  On the program  we have nine Nobel Laureates  several CEOs of major corporations  and other heavy hitters.  As you can see  there is a major technology slant to this year's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some representation from Enron in the audience.  Second  we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have attached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the various levels ($10K - $100K)  and the benefits of each sponsorship tier. This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers and a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on your organization for support.  We anticipate a global audience of 1 500 - senior people from the financial sector  business  technology  academia  the policy community and all the major media.  In just two years  our Global Conference has become a significant and influential gathering for discussion  debate and networking on key business  economic  financial and policy questions.  I hope we can count on you.  Regards   Donald H.

According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG  exploitation of this  opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one  as far  as we know  has constructed such a vessel.    I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the  Italian company Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they  have not built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel  would take 2-3 years  and as one might imagine  achieving the required  operational and  environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.   Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel  http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm  Please let me know if any further research is needed.

jeffrey_a_shankman|Sent|Wells Fargo visit to Houston|Get with George Z. and get this on the calendar.  Thanks.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT on 12/18/2000  10:32 AM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  George Zivic                           12/18/2000 10:24 AM 	  To: Jeff Kinneman/HOU/ECT@ECT  Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT cc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT (bcc: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT) Subject: Wells Fargo visit to Houston  Jeff K.   Just a follow up to our prior conversations.  Representatives from Wells Fargo will be visiting Enron on Tuesday  January  9  2001.  As initially discussed  Wells is looking to learn more about Enron's overall  risk management/trading capabilities and to explore potential areas of  co-operation --  areas where the two organisations may benefit from working  together . Wells is incredibly interested in the breadth of markets that  Enron is currently involved in. My sense is that  with a mandate to grow  their capital market reach  Wells will be looking to us as a potential  strategic partner in taking many of our capabilities to their immense  corporate client base.  Based on my relationship with them  they have expressed special interest in  EnronCredit. The form of this seems quite interesting. My sense is that they  have explored building their own credit derivative capabilities and for  various reasons feel that it may be more efficient/economical to build some  sort of shared capabilities with our group -- I think that our focus on  solutions for the corporate risk manager is attractive to them. In addition  to this  their Chief Credit Officer will be joining on this date to explore  our capabilities in assisting with management of the Bank's credit portfolio.  Based on my discussions with them and my sense of their interest in exploring  various types of working relationships with us  I would suggest that we have  a senior presence at this meeting.  This being said  they also have a great deal of interest in speaking to the  Heads of all our other risk management/commodity desks. My hope is that Jeff  Shankman will be available to discuss/introduce Enron Global Markets which  would then be followed with product presentations from all desks interested  (Mark Tawney has already agreed to presenting our Weather Derivative  capabilities). Also  our Global Finance Group has expressed their interest in  participating during these discussions.   It has been indicated to me that the following people will be attending from  Wells Fargo: Treasurer Chief Credit Officer Sr. VP  & Head of Product Development  Capital Markets Head of Derivative Sales  My hope is to finalise an agenda by the end of the week. In order to  accomplish this  I would like to discuss (as a group) the best format in  which to present -- one which will ensure an accurate representation of our  capabilities and of our interest in developing this relationship.

kate_symes|'sent mail|Salsa Madness!|Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first  Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m.  with live music  and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays  of the month have live music and dancing  no class unfortunately. Anyway  I'm  sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par  with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.  Do you want to try it out? Next class is Feb. 6. Mark your calendars and tell  all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.  Kate  Viva bailar * Symes *Does this mean  live dance  or  dance lives  or  my friend Viva likes the  way you dance  or none of the above?  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.

shapiro-r|All documents| Today's Senate Hearing|The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held an unusually long hearing  today (9:30 am to 4:30 pm) on FERC's responses to the California situation  and other related energy issues.  The  star witness  was Gov. Davis.  Others  were Govs. Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps   Sens. Murkowski  Murray and Cantwell  Washington State's attorney general   Oregon's PUC chairman  and the five FERC commissioners.  Once Davis left  after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions  most of the  press and audience left.  Enron was mentioned several times as follows:   1. Sen. Thompson  the Ranking Republican  mentioned Lockyer's  Spike   comments in the context of asking Gov. Davis about why business would make  new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty  there  is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials.   Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not.  (Thompson gave him a  second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific  reference again to  Spike   asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of  the AG's Spike comments.)  The first time Davis said that the people he  represents are mad  they want him to fight back  this is rough business  the  industry people are used to a wildcatter's environment  things occassionally  get out of hand  and we are not going to take it.  On the second instance  he  said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not  being diminished.   2. Sen. Bennett (R-UT) did an excellent job questioning Gov. Davis about his  handling of the situation  using quotes from California newspapers to make  the case that Davis was slow to act.  He also argued that the state had done  a bad job as a power purchaser  contrasting the state's recent 8-year  contract with Constellation for power at $150 peak and $59 off-peak with  Enron's willingness last year to sell them power for five years at $50.  The  Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks out-of-state generators but  is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more.  Davis  said they should make refunds  too.   3. While not saying Enron by name  Gov. Davis did make a comment about  companies with  trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange  with meteorologists and very talented people  who might have the ability to  find loopholes in the new order.  He said this in answer to a question about  what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued  and he said  watch  out for manipulation  by those subject to the order.   4. Sen. Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared  to be investigating out-of-state suppliers even though they had a small  percentage of the market in her state  with lots of document requests and  other investigative action  while not doing the same to others.  During that  exchange either Thompson or the AG (I think it was the AG) said Enron had  over $1 billion in sales to Washington State.  Enron was not on the list of  companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands.   She said she would be expanding her inquiry  though.  Highlights and Analysis   1. As started at yesterday's Senate Energy hearing  the mantra from the  Western Democrats was: we want our money back.  Chairman Lieberman and others  pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other  Western states  particularly Oregon and Washington.  Chairman Hebert said  that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all  issues  including refunds in California and outside California.  He said that  the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on  itself  including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act.   Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERC's  activities in implementing the new order  particularly as it relates to  refunds.  While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to  pending cases  he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the 60 day  delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds.   2. Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and  enforcement tools available to the commission  including the ability to order  short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business   treble damages  and other administrative penalties.  There was also  discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERC's  market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC  FCC and  FTC than it has in the past.   3. The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERC's  latest order is a step in the right direction.  None of them called for  legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens. Feinstein and Smith.   Sen. Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated  price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that  the bill's sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at  yesterday's hearing.  Davis did say the still thinks that cost-based rates  are better  but he said the new order is  some price relief  and that it  corrected the mistakes in the April order.   4. There was some discussion of natural gas again.  Davis said that FERC  should now turn its attention to natural gas.  He said that El Paso  controlled too much of the capacity until recently.  He called on FERC to  enforce laws against price manipulation.  (Note: we have had several back  channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso  and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues.)   5. There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order.   Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept. 2002 is too soon.   Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of 2002 if not  more time and that order should apply until California has enough new  generation in place.  Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman  later in the hearing  saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on  new supplies  however he and the others basically said they would revisit the  issue if events warrant.   6. Several times  Sen. Lieberman and others said they generally support  deregulation  but that the effort to get more states to do so will never  happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public  confidence restored.   7. Gov. Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres. Bush and Pat Wood   saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to  California  including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of  transportation to California.  He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that  FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush  appointees were on the commission.   8. Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept. or the  FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices.  She said not to her  knowledge even though she has asked them to do so.  We can expect a  Lieberman  et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward  I  suspect.   9. While Chairman Lieberman's tone and closing comments were in the nature  of his normal thoughtful tone  it is clear that he and others see this as a  major issue for them to ride.  He commended FERC at the end of the hearing  for doing their best  but pledged he would stay involved  closing the session  with a smile and the words  see you soon.   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.

griffith-j|Discussion threads| Re: Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation|Sandy   As a result of recent contract re-negotiations  the proposed Cabot Oil & Gas  Marketing Corporation deals in Terrebonne Parish has changed significantly.   First  our reserve study has been completed and we have determined that the  Turtle Bayou Field production is expected to last only 18 months.  Second   Cabot has balked at our tiered pricing proposal  so 100% of the production  will be index priced.  Third  Cabot will only commit its working interest  share of production  not its partners' share.  Fourth  one of the 4 wells  (Castex #1) has been removed from the contract.  Finally  Cabot has indicated  it will not accept a price less than index flat.  A revised expectation of volumes for the two Cabot deals is attached.  For  the Transco Turtle Bayou Field  the intitial volume is expected to be 9 406  Mmbtu/d for 01/2001 declining to 7 049 Mmbtu/d for 05/2002; please obtain a  bid from the East desk for this gas for the period indicated.  For the  Tennessee Kent Bayou Field  the initial volume is expected to be 9 570  Mmbtu/d for 01/2001 declining to 7 121 Mmbtu/d for 12/2003; please obtain a  bid from the East desk for this gas for the period indicated.

shackleton-s|All documents| Trades Terminated or in Dispute|Pursuant to our conversation  the different scenarios for trades in dispute  are (and may not be limited to) the following:  Trade agreed Trade not booked    No confirm sent Trade agreed Trade booked  Killed on T/D  No confirm sent Trade agreed Trade booked  Killed after T/D  No confirm sent Trade agreed Trade booked  Trade killed  Confirm sent  Trade booked Trade disputed     No Confirm sent Trade booked  Trade disputed     Confirm sent  Examples:  Scenario 1: the CP calls back one hour after the trade was agreed and states  they now do not agree with the trade. Essentially  it could be disputed  wether or not we had a trade  even though our tapes support our position. No  impact on booking or Confirmation Desk.  Scenarios 2 and 3 occur essentially the same as Scenario 1 with the exception  that the trade is booked. Scenario 2 and 3 a different based on the pricing  implication of a trade booked overnight. In both these scenarios  we should  consider issuing a Termination Agreement which gives some reference to the  details of the agreed transaction.  Scenario 4 is the most straight-forward. An agreed trade  booked and  Confirmed  we issue a Termination Agreement.  Scenarios 5 and 6 are different from Scenarios 2 and 3 in that we have booked  a trade based on our understanding  but OUR understanding of the terms was  incorrect. The two scenarios are different in that in 5 a Confirmation is not  sent. In 5  we should consider issuing a side letter stating that a trade was  booked in error and no such trade exists. In 6 we should consider issuing a  side letter stating the trade was booked AND the Confirmation was sent in  error - and ask that they return the Confirmation.   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.

dutch_quigley|Sent Items| |06/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL E.10 (Copyright 2001)  THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that  but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it  maybe  had he not been saying the other things.  Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt  their very breath can be toxic  and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. Take Enron  the energy company  or Chevron  another energy company  or El Paso Natural Gas  yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute.  And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail  but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth.  We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create  shortages  whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for  maintenance ? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not.  But it was more convenient to forget those things  and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling  and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes  but the bureaucrats are inadequate  so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised.  Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't.  AND SOMEHOW  EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one  we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun  we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need.  I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used.  We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has.  Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is  means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money  we kept it for 40 years  now -- prove that you need it!  Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives  who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch!  I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains  and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money.  We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness  we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind  but now we see. And we await developments  or create them.   *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.

mark_taylor|All documents|Re: Option Language|If they can figure out a way to do it  more power to them - but there are  only just so many characters available in the short description line.      	Greg Johnston 	03/12/2001 02:18 PM 		 		 To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT  Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT  Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 Subject: Re: Option Language  Mark  you are right on the second point.  I think we are probably okay  there.  I understand from our option traders that they intend to set the  products themselves up on EOL to address the different calculations in the  products themselves rather than coming up with different long descriptions  for each.  Does that make any sense or should we be setting up separate long  descriptions for each of the types of options they want to offer?   From: Mark Taylor on 03/12/2001 01:28 PM CST To: Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT  Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT  Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Option Language    Greg:  It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put.  There is nowhere else on  the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical  Long Description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and  calls.  So far there have not been any collars  straddles  etc. offered.  On the second change  it looked to me like the preceding sentence already  covers the treatment of holidays:    ...at the end of such day (normally being 4:05 p.m. (MPT)) on EnronOnline (or  for Saturdays  Sundays and statutory holidays  at the end of the day on the  preceding business day)...  which makes the deleted language redundant.    	Greg Johnston 	03/12/2001 11:30 AM 		 		 To: Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT  Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT  Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 Subject: Re: Option Language  Melba  I have reviewed the proposed changes and I do not believe that they  should be made.  The change to the calculation of the Cash Settlement Amount  to specify it is the Strike Price minus the Index doesn't work unless the  option is a put.  We want this long description to work for all options  (puts  calls  collars  etc.) and for each of those the calculation of the  Cash Settlement Amount is different.  That is the reason that we originally  put in the generic language that the Cash Settlement Amount is  the greater  of zero or the amount calculated as set forth on the Website   such that the  actual calculation mechanism for the Cash Settlement Amount will be set forth  in each specific product.  Therefore  I would suggest we change it back to  the original wording.  On the second change  I know that the wording that was removed is important  to our traders.  If the description is silent on holiday pricing (which will  be the case if we make the suggested change)  I am not sure as to what the  default is.  We need to make sure that the default where the pricing for  holidays is not specified is exactly the same as the wording removed   otherwise the wording removed needs to be put back in.  I am also not clear  on why we would remove the wording in the first place and create any  uncertainty as to holiday pricing.  Thanks Greg   To: Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT  Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT  Subject: Option Language  Greg   Attached please find the language for the Option products.  I need final  approval from you. Changes were suggested by Mark Taylor.

holden_salisbury|Inbox|NEVP transmission| Please be aware that the last leg of transmission listed on tag #28010 is a dummy leg of transmission that needs to be placed on the tag in order to reflect Valley Electrics Load at Mead 230.  We use this dummy leg of transmission because Valley Electric does not have a PSE acronym in the OATI tagging system.  We have been creating tags such as this since the OATI tagging system has been in use and have not or should not be getting charged for using NEVP trani.  Please refer to the following tag numbers as examples:  22655  22654  26279  26387.  Please note that each of these tags was approved by NEVP the control area and NEVP the transmission provider and therefore has been implemented.   It was our understanding that this was a practice agreed upon by NEVP and Enron in order to reflect Valley Electrics load at Mead.   My contact at Nevp is Jannella Battles.   Please  keep me in the loop as to what the result of this issue will be.

From ENA's perspective  I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However  Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.  Questions that need to be answered   	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier? 	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?  	  The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213)  she is one of the managers over the operations group.

shapiro-r|All documents| RE: Eu Liberalisation: Procedure and Substance of an Art 86(3) Directive|COMMENTS BELOW TO PAUL'S QUESTIONS.    From: Paul Hennemeyer/Enron@EUEnronXGate on 07/03/2001 09:51 AM GDT To: Brendan Devlin/EU/Enron@Enron  Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron  Peter  Styles/LON/ECT@ECT  Paul Dawson/Enron@EUEnronXGate  Doug  Wood/Enron@EUEnronXGate cc: Nailia Dindarova/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: RE: Eu Liberalisation: Procedure and Substance of an Art 86(3)  Directive  Devlin  Thanks for the note. Very useful. A few questions for clarification:  1. Can the Directive do nothing about legal unbundling? As I understand it  this involves no change in ownership but just a requirement that the owners of Company X spin off their network operations into a  different company - which they would still own.  NO; ANY CHANGE IN THE LEGAL STRUCTURE WOULD BE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF SUCH A  DIRECTIVE.  EVEN IF ULTIMATE OWNERSHIP REMAINS UNCHANGED  FORCING A  STRUCTURAL CHANGE WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE.  MIND YOU  IT WAS UNTIL RECENTLY  THOUGHT THAT THE COMMISSION COULD NOT REQUIRE DIVESTMENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF A  MERGER REVIEW.  2. It seems that your statement that  only States can be addressed  opens up  the possibility that States could  following an  86-based Directive  undertake a range of actions - including forcing a more level playing field by  requiring more unbundling and regulated TPA. Is this correct?  YES  3.What specific actions might be undertaken by the Commission as part of  86-based Directive?   Thanks  Paul        -----Original Message----- From:  Devlin  Brendan   Sent: 02 July 2001 17:55 To: Shapiro  Richard; Styles  Peter; Hennemeyer  Paul; Dawson  Paul; Wood   Doug Cc: Dindarova  Nailia Subject: Eu Liberalisation: Procedure and Substance of an Art 86(3) Directive  This e-mail is for background information so that we can have a clear view on  the prospects and content of  an eventual Art 86(3) Directive.    The current European Commission's Directive is based on Art. 95 of the  Amsterdam Treaty; this is an harmonisation Directive  which means that it can  address any issue likely to impede cross-border flows of goods and services   and can have positive effects (such as requirements to set up a regulator).   An Art 86(3) Directive  on the other hand  can only address concerns within  the context of Art 86: Art 86 stipulates that member States of the EU shall  not favour government owned entities or other entities  to whom public  service obligations (PSO) have been assigned  unless such favour is necesary  for that entity to carry out it's P.S.O..  Art 86(3) Directives are  prohibitive and preventative  rather than prescriptive.  In short  Art. 86 means that the competition rules apply to EdF  and if the  member state won't enforce a level field  the Commission will.  In procedural terms  Art. 86(3) Directives do not have to be passed by the  Council (member states) nor by the Parliament  though in practice the  Commission does not act unilaterally and seeks tacit cover. Thus  in the  Telecomms sector  when the member States found it too hard politically to  liberalise  they engineered an impasse in Council and invited sotto voce the  Commission to force them to do it. In effect  the Stockholm Council's  Conclusions are a similar coded request (the reference to competition rules  would include Art. 86). Once before the College of the Commission  an Art  86(3) directive has to be agreed by simple a majority vote of all  Commissioners (even if they are absent  so you need 11 positive votes). It  cannot be blocked by a single Commissioner. Even if France/Germany combine   there would be 16 positive votes and four against.  What can an Art 86(3) Directive do?  -- Enforce accounts and management unbundling (not legal unbundling as that  entails change of ownership). -- Abolish any exclusive rights that have an anti-competitive effect (such as  exclusive use of infrastructure  rights to import/export  interconnector  rights?). -- Broadly speaking  force liberalisation in a utilities sector.  What an Art 86(3) Directive cannot do?  -- Force any legal person to do anything (companies  individuals etc). Only  States can be addressed. -- Address positive regulatory issues (set tariffs  create regulators   capacity upgrades  etc).  In Summary: An Art 86(3) directive would be different from the directive  already on the table; it would be more focussed and less general and would  provide remedies for identified anti-competitive activities.    Action:  We should be in a position to place before the Commission an array  of anti-competitive actions that can be remedied by an Art. 86(3) Directive   especially with regard to exclusive rights..

perlingiere-d|Sent| PanCanadian Energy Services|FYI  In reference to your memo of May 5th   I prepared and sent a new Master to  Pan on May 1st.  Since then  I have trouble getting in touch with anyone at  Pan to discuss the agreement.   The treasurer  referred me to  Rick Tucker  (713) 331-5049.  He stated Pan is not ready to consider new paper  as the one  in place is working fine and not priority.   But would review the new  agreement when he had time.

sager-e|Epmi - power| Password Security Notice|For Password Renewals Only   IT Security & Controls ) Password Security Notice   Passwords The key to maintaining information and system security is the use of  well-selected and guarded passwords.  Because your password is our first line  of defense  stronger password selection criteria will soon be implemented for  all employees.    Password Policy  Passwords( 1. must be at least of eight characters in length.  2. must not contain names  userids  common English dictionary words  and  begin or end with a number. 3. must contain alphanumeric characters and contain at least one special  character. No more than fifty percent of the overall password can be in  English. 4. must not be reused or cyclical.  5. must be changed every 60 days. 6. must not be publicly displayed. 7. must not be shared with other users.   Choosing a good password comes down to two things.  First  avoid common  everyday words a potential hacker s software will be looking for.  Second   keep your password  simple enough that you can remember it without having to  write it down.   Please keep in mind that the Enron Code of Ethics holds employees responsible  for password security.  IT Security & Controls conducts periodic audits to  ensure compliance with company policy.   http://itc.corp.enron.com/data/policiesandprocedures/ITPasswordScreenSaver/  For any problems encountered concerning password controls  please call your  appropriate Resolution Center (available: 24Hrs./day  7 days/week).  *********** EDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML  PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies  Inc.
